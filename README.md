# ruby-hardway
These are files from "Learn Ruby the Hard Way," beginning with Exercise 3. Instructions in the lessons were followed closely, with some exercises tinkered with later.

ex2.rb: From Lesson 3, actually, this introduced the wide variety of math options, and their application. Most were intuitive, but modulus was a dormant concept I had learned in C++ many years ago, as was floating point.

ex4.rb: Lesson 4 was a simple introduction to variables and names.

ex5.rb: The biggest thing from Lesson 5 was the introduction of embedding variables within strings.

ex6.rb: A short but important lesson on variables with complex strings. 

ex7.rb: Another string lesson, but this one was tricky. I promise I followed the author's adminition to type and not copy-paste these things.

ex8.rb: Introduction to format strings, a "formatter" function if you will. Author promises he will expound on the concept later in the book.

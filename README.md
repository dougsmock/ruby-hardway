# ruby-hardway
These are files from "Learn Ruby the Hard Way," beginning with Exercise 3. Instructions in the lessons were followed closely, with some exercises tinkered with later.

ex2.rb: From Lesson 3, actually, this introduced the wide variety of math options, and their application. Most were intuitive, but modulus was a dormant concept I had learned in C++ many years ago, as was floating point.

ex4.rb: Lesson 4 was a simple introduction to variables and names.

ex5.rb: The biggest thing from Lesson 5 was the introduction of embedding variables within strings.

ex6.rb: A short but important lesson on variables with complex strings. 

ex7.rb: Another string lesson, but this one was tricky. I promise I followed the author's adminition to type and not copy-paste these things.

ex8.rb: Introduction to format strings, a "formatter" function if you will. Author promises he will expound on the concept later in the book.

ex9.rb: A continuation of the previous two exercises, but with two notable items: The proper use of \n and the puts %q command to print an entire block of text at once.

ex10.rb: This is an introduction to using a \ to "escape" characters from strings, i.e., \\, \' , \" , \t* (horizontal tab), etc.

ex11.rb: Finally, we start to handle inputs and return values. The "gets.chomp" command is introduced.

ex12.rb: We prompt the user for numbers and handle those according to script. The integer-handling function gets.chomp.to_i is introduced. 
 
ex13.rb: This exercise introduced the concept of a script accepting arguments and "unpacking" ARGV.

ex14.rb: This exercise uses ARGV and gets.chomp together to ask the user something specific. This sets up Exercise 15, where we earn to read and write files. 

ex15.rb: This exercise introduces reading from a file and ouputting that. 

ex16.rb: Commands to learn and remember include close, read, readline, truncate, write('stuff') and seek(0).

ex17.rb: Very short exercise on copying one filed to another.

ex18.rb: The introduction to functions, and four of many different ways to do them. Three facets the author gives: (1) Functions name pieces of code the way variables name strings and numbers. (2) They take arguments the way your scripts take ARGV. (3) Using 1 and 2, they let you make your own "mini-scripts" or "tiny commands." 

ex19.rb: The variables in your function are not connected to the variables in your script, which is throwing me off early in this class. This chapter covers that.

ex20.rb: The study of functions continues, showing how functions and files work together.

ex21.rb: Time to see how functions can accept arguments and return answers to math equations and/or strings. The "return" command is introduced, though a author-suggested test shows the script defaults to perform the last calculation. 

ex24.rb: A short but wide-ranging review of what we have done in the opening chapters; nothing really new.
